# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through using Alphabet Soup to solve word search puzzles.

## Loading a Puzzle

There are three ways to load a word search puzzle:

### 1. Select an Example

The easiest way to get started is to select one of the built-in examples from the dropdown menu. These examples demonstrate different puzzle sizes and word lists.

### 2. Upload a Text File

Click the file input button to upload a `.txt` or `.wordsearch` file. The file should follow the [file format](/file-format) specification.

### 3. AI Image Parsing

If you have an image of a word search puzzle (such as a photo or screenshot), you can use the AI-powered image parsing feature. See the [AI Parsing](/ai-parsing) guide for details.

## Viewing Results

Once a puzzle is loaded:

1. **Words to Find** - The left panel shows all words that need to be found
2. **Word Search Grid** - The right panel displays the letter grid
3. **Answers** - Below the words list, you'll see found answers with their coordinates

## Highlighting Words

Click on any word in the "Words to Find" list to:

- Highlight the word in the list
- Show all matching locations in the grid with colored cells
- Highlight the corresponding answer(s) in the Answers panel

## Circle Overlay

Click the **Circle Answers** button to toggle stadium-shaped circles around all found words in the grid. This provides a traditional word search visualization.

When circles are visible:
- Hover over a circle to highlight that specific word
- The corresponding word and answer will also be highlighted
